##### Factions in Arctic Lands
  
  
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | The Frost Architects - A tribe of wizard-monks who eat nothing but snow and creating ice towers using only their breath.
| 2.  |  Mammoth Joeys - Tribes who travel by clinging onto the underside of mammoths. They go where the mammoth lead them and help them fend off predators while gorging off milk and warmth from their hosts.
| 3.  | The Conflagration Conclave - A school or university for aspiring Wizards and Sorcerers focused on Fire magic. They burn away the snow and ice to find ground and grow their own food and plant trees that usually cannot grow on the frozen mountain tops. Creating small habitats of woodlands on the snowy peaks.
| 4.  | Frostclaws - A nomadic clan of fireborn dragonborn who use their inherent inner fire to stay naturally warm in this inhospitable gelid environment.
| 5.  | Krygos - A race that appears human in their daily life, but when threatened or empassioned, transform into their alternative form: white scaled reptilian people who turn their prey into ice through touch.
| 6.  | Selkies - An ancient shapeshifting race that, although human for the most part, has the ability to transform into a seal at will as long as they have their sealskin with them.
| 7.  | Sleepers - A tribe that has mastered the art of hibernation. During the harshest winters they let the ice take them, encasing themselves into frozen prisms awaiting for the next spring. Adventurers may often mistaken suspended bodies with what may seem like ice mummies, unaware that they are very much alive and watching back.
| 8.  | The Um’bu’gm - Highly secretive barbarians who only speak to each other below the frozen water.
| 9.  | The þursar Nomads - A race/faction, created for my own setting that I'm working on. They are a mix between Humans and the Jǫtunn of the Fjarlægð Tundra - effectively considered half-giants , though they lean more towards their Human parent, reaching upto 3~3.5m in height. After their banishment to the Far North, the Dýrætt clan settled in what would later become Dýrlanð - a small patch of fertile land in the middle of the Tundra. Although enemies at first, fighting for each's survival in the frozen lands, the Dýrætt and Jǫtunn eventually found peace in the unlikely matching between Järl Iger Dýrsson and Thilda of the Jǫtnar. Unfortunately,  this peace only lasted a few generations as after both Iger and Thilda passed, the Elder Council of Dýrlanð (consisting largely of Humans and few Jǫtnar) started a campaign of dissent and hatred between the two races - seeking to banish the giants from Dýrlanð. After several years of suffering, the Jǫtnar and þursar of Dýrlanð eventually settled their minds to leave peacefully, though there had been more than enough provocations on the side of the Humans, who were clearly hoping to spark a full-out war to eradicate them. Leaving the fertile lands of Dýrlanð, the giants adopted a nomadic life - something the Jǫtnar were ill-suited for. This resulted in the race's almost complete extinction in the harshness of the Fjarlægð.
| 10. | A group of prisoners cursed to walk in frozen lands forever, where ever they go. They are constantly surrounded by a raging blizzard sphere which often catches adventurers off guard. Some survivors thought they heard the haunting jingle of chains, others thought they saw marching shadows in the winds.

##### Random encounters in a desolate desert, ravaged by evil forces
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | A sandstorm comes up for an hour or so, when it fades, the remains of a battlefield is visible. There are human, tiefling, minotaur, and dragonborn remains. Some loot may still be around- but taking from the long-dead might be ill-advised. (Roll a 1d4 if the players take the chance. The higher, the better. 1 = Skeletons of long dead warriors rise up to fight the party! 2 = They find some loot... and it's in good condition. Unfortunately, it's also cursed, and will wreak havoc on the dreams of whoever wields the equipment in question. 3 = Equipment. Good stuff. 4 = A circle of skeletons, surrounding a sole waterskin, filled with cool waters. It isn't cursed. Just a gift, from spirits long dead.)
| 2.  | Players can hear it when it draws near, the sounds of chaotic shattering, a violent chime that tells a nature of discord. A glass elemental composed of a vortex of twisting shards, a failed experiment abandoned by some wizard very long gone now. It seeks to destroy things with order in pure envy.
| 3.  | Felt more than heard, an unsettling vibration grows gradually, then becomes violent as the entire desert seems to shake and ripple, possibly knocking the party off their feet [Dex/Reflex save, attack vs Reflex, etc.].  Flying party members who rise high enough above the area of vibration can see the disturbance forms a vast kite-like shape, nearly a mile in all directions.  Once the vibration has subsided a bit, off in the distance in the direction the vibration went, a colossal rounded leathery wingtip breaks the surface as the ray-like creature dives back into the sandy depths.|
| 4.  | Rend Dragon. Composed of solidified echoes and shifting sands. This is a dragon without skin nor organs. It is the idea of abrasiveness made manifest, a living glacier of dust and world-shards it wears away all land it passes, carving its way through what is left of the world. It wanders endlessly trying in vain to recall the world as it once-was.
| 5.  | Mirage sorcerer. A hermetic sorcerer who uses illusion magic to disorient adventurers for easy pickings. The players may believe they see a child in need, or a desperately sought treasure, or simply an oasis in the desert. An arcana check or "detect magic" will reveal it is an illusion, and the caster lies in wait like a burrowing spider in a bolt hole in the sand. If a player walks within 20 feet of their lair they must succeed in a dexterity saving throw or fall through a false floor into the sorcerer's lair.
| 6.  | The Lair of Jahazabaara the Brass (a friendly Brass Dragon who lives in a ruined observatory, half-buried beneath the sands. The place is utterly decrepit, and creatures both small and large may have moved in while the dragon slumbers... but should you make it to the observation room, you'll be in for a lengthy chat with one of the more sociable, pleasant dragon-types.)
| 7.  | How about a team of Halfling expeditioners that snuck into the ruins to steal treasures? You find half the team just outside the ruins, badly injured and exhausted. It seems that they have found a valuable artifact from their exploration, but they are more concerned about the other half of their team that hasn't made it back out from the sea of sand. They promise to share with you their findings if you help to rescue their friends that were left behind in the winding tunnels underground.
| 8.  | A ripple rolls across the sand in front of the party. If they fail a perception check, it ripples in between the party and a gigantic claw shoots up, snapping at one of the party members. And out emerges a giant scorpion. If the party is over a certain level, scale the encounter to a Huge instead of Large scorpion (scale damage appropriately), add a few more of them that ambush the party as well. Or, if they are above level 10, go hard or go home. Scale it to a gargantuan scorpion, with damage appropriate for the size of such a creature.
| 9.  | The party stumbles across an ancient city, wracked by the Rending. Ancient Artifacts lie waiting in the mage academy which once prospered, here- but the local citizenry have been turned into ghouls, who wait patiently for the next living thing foolish enough to plunder their city... and within the academy, once bright students and masters have been turned into gibbering Abberations. Should you survive it all, there may be a vault, filled with artifacts both large and small.
| 10. | A 'Golden Oasis' (An oasis with both food and fresh water) appears before the group, as they travel through the desert. A very rare sight, to be sure, in this god-forsaken place. An elderly dragonborn man is sitting next to a camel, looking tired. Magical Scrutiny will reveal that he's not alive, per se. More of a... ghost. An echo of someone who was alive, a long time ago. He admits to being lost and was very grateful to find this oasis. If the party is kind and gives him food [he has plenty of water], he will tell them that he passed a strange sight some time back – a dragonborn palace that seemed like it had been sheered in half somehow. He can point the party in the direction they want to go but admits he isn’t sure how long it will take the party to get there. Future rolls of '10' will simply be fake mirages. A distant vision of an Oasis, which isn't real.

##### Simple puzzles encountered in a tomb/crypt?
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | The Cubed Door/Chest - A sturdy stone door lies before your party, five (or more) roughly hewn stone cubes lie in the centre of the door with inscriptions in an ancient language on them (select whatever language is appropriate), below the cubes is a large circle that looks like it can be pressed inwards. No obvious handles or method of opening the door seems to be visible. When translated the ancient language on the cubes seem to spell out single letters, you are able to rotate each cube, when rotated each cube has different letters on each facing. The objective of the puzzle is to rotate each cube to spell something that will unseal the door when the stone button is pressed. Entering in the wrong phrase should have consequences, maybe a couple of nearby skeletons spring to life as necromantic magic floods the room (or crypt horrors, I guess it depends on your party level, that's up to the DM, make it level appropriate). Be sure to drop your players a hint at some point in the dungeon, (Like, maybe inscription outside that reads Speak Friend and Enter or a cryptic warning somewhere else in the dungeon). If you're feeling particularly devious have the meaning and intent of the words be lost in translation and require a little more effort from your players. :innocent:
| 2. | A Half Finished Game - You find a room with two skeletons sitting on wooden stools hunched over a table, both aren't of the moving variety (yet?). In the middle is a chess board with a half played game of chess (or whatever the equivalent in your world is). On the other side of the room is a locked stone door. Now, for this to work you have to describe the position of the pieces on the board and that the tiles on the board seem to indent slightly where pieces are. And also, describe the room and the skeletons in laborious detail. Seriously, go overboard (if you have a chessboard to organise the pieces even better). If they try and open or pick lock the door on the far side it won't budge. The solution, the door is stuck, nothing a bit of brute force won't fix, and the puzzle isn't really a puzzle, its' two dead guys that died during a game of chess and maybe were positioned like that to mess with intruders by the resident necromancer or something. What makes it work is the psychology involved, if you put a lot of effort into describing a scene like that your players will almost certainly try and figure out what's going on and be deeply suspicious of the room while trying to solve the 'puzzle' and look for hidden meanings that aren't there. This will only work once however (and is most effective in either a magic-warped area to conceal the fact there's no magic at play, or if nobody has detect magic), if you try and pull this too often (IE, more than once every few years)  they'll try and force every door they see. Don't try it if you can't keep a straight face and deadpan expression while you narrate it in great detail.
| 3.  | Pose Gallery — An even number of 5ft pressure plates (4, 6, or 8, based on party size) line a room, separated from each other by high walls. In front of each plate is a velvet curtain. Pulling back the curtains reveals an empty recess set into the wall behind them. When all pressure plates are occupied by players, they depress for 5 seconds. Half of the curtains sweep back magically to reveal mirrors. The other half part to reveal ivory skeletons, frozen in mid-gesture (waving, saluting, cheering, praying, etc…) The players in front of mirrors must reproduce the gestures shown by the skeletons. After 5 seconds without a correct solution, the puzzle resets. The poses and mirror placement are randomly determined each time.
| 4.  | Another dead end, but this time there is a colorful but faded mural of a dying serpent. It takes up the left half of the wall whilst on the right there is an engraving in an exact copy of the left, except it has no color at all. Players will have to scour the dungeon for a source of paint, whether it be blood, goo, bile, saliva, crushed up crystals... whatever it may be to repaint the mural on the right to match the left. Only then will the wall give way to a secret entrance or another clue to these mysterious tombs.

##### Potions and Unexpected Effects
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Potion of Cats Grace : Potion doubles your dexterity modifier. If you have a negative modifier, now it's twice as low. Lasts 1D4 rounds. Roll a wisdom save, on 10 or below you are now extremely distractible by animals typically hunted by cats.
| 2.  | Tincture of Sight (Potion, very rare) : A beautiful, purple bottle, containing a hard, yet sweet liquor. A sip reveals a person's true nature, while a whole cupful is said to reveal the machines which run the world, driving a body insane... but extremely knowledgable, for the potion's duration.
| 3.  | Jellied Fog Eggs (Consumable, uncommon) : Held in a bottle, these small eggs were harvested from free-range air elementals. Once cracked, the eggs produce a pleasing mist which invigorates the spirit and calms the nerves. Consuming an egg, or several, can have certain consequences. If you're lucky, you might start floating, or, hell- even soaring through the air, as per a Fly spell. But if unlucky, you could get some... really... bad... gas. So think carefully before eating!
| 4.  | Potion of damage sight : A favourite amongst clerics, this lights up any areas where a person has been hurt, the brighter the glow the more severe the damage, and gives you advantage on medicine rolls to heal that person. If the person has mental trauma you become dazzled from the light from their head for 1D4 rounds or until you look away
| 5.  | Potion of race disguise : The potion can specifically change the race that your character appears to be, limited to those which share a size class with them. It is a polymorph potion so they do physically change into that race, and it cannot be undone until it wears off. They will retain the racial modifiers they began with, and gain only the NEGATIVE AFFECTS of the race they change into, such as the light sensitivity in drows.
| 6.  | Potion of Feign Death , whoever drinks this potion appears to everyone attempting to check, by magical means or otherwise, that he/she is dead and under the effect of Gentle Repose. The user is actually paralyzed and fully aware until the effect ends
| 7.  | Potion of Hindsight. The user gets a +7 perception bonus on figuring out what could have been different to prevent a certain effect  (wording is hard but i assume you get what it does)
| 8.  | Potion of True Form, Appears to be a Potion of Polymorph, however turns the user into a familiar like creature similar to their personality for 10 minutes.
| 9. | Potion of the Decaying Mind, Grants the user Truesight but reduces the intelligence of the user to 1 for the duration. The user remembers everything that he/she witnessed after the effect ends (be it real or a figment of his/her ailing mind)
| 10. | Syringe of Timestop. This alchemical concoction, unlike how it's name suggests, doesn't stop time so much as it slows it. The name, instead, refers to what happens to those who -die- while having drank it. Their perception of time slows down, as they lie bleeding- until they're stuck in an endless pit of constant death- never living, but never truly passing on. Should it be consumed, the imbiber may take two additional actions. Each action must be of another type- so, as an example... Standard/Move, or Reaction/Bonus. As a potion of significant power, it's rarity is classified as "Very Rare".

##### Excuses for a player's character to be absent for a session
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | They wander into some sort of trap, leading to the Big Bad Evil Dude (or a minor antagonist!) kidnapping them! The effectiveness of this technique varies wildly depending on group composition, if the others care about the PC in question, and whether you're willing to cut in some extra work to set it all up.
| 2. | character was dragged off to a very niche and important cultural holiday. They have to explain the holiday. In detail.
| 3. | character caught a viral illness. Depending on how many in game hours/weeks the last session took this can be very funny. They have a -1D4 to their constitution for the session if they pick this one and have to name the illness and describe the symptoms.
| 4. | The character falls unconscious. They cannot be roused by any means. They are under the effects of a magical Dream spell, and are seeing, or hearing, strange things. Perhaps an elder being from beyond the cosmos has taken an interest in the group, for some reason- maybe a Fae is playing a cruel trick, or, quite possibly- the BBEG is having a private chat with the character in question... an example being: Strahd has perfect control of Barovia, and, by extent- the Ravenloft module. He can visit your characters in their dreams, but in this case, he might've put a Hex of sorts on the PC in question- making them more susceptible to his magical commands.
| 5.  | Kidnapped by Goblins, and worshipped as a deity. Has to explain to the party how they got out in detail and why they have a sassy goblin servant named Grub now. How useful this is to the party depends on the group.
| 6.  | Chara got ambushed by a doppelganger during their watch and replaced. They were left naked and bound somewhere and the doppel has replaced them.
| 7.  | Arrested. What for? You tell me. How did they get out? How much of their gold did they have to leave behind?
| 8.  | No time to explain! The character was taken to a near future where their assistance was needed. They would have vague information of an event happening in the future, up to the DM's discretion.
| 9.  | Character went on a drinking splurge and has little recollection of what they have done. Can go around town retracing their steps and figuring out what they had done on their night of debauchery. Are they banned from a bar? Did he insult a Noble? Who knows?
| 10. | Character found a secret romantic interest. You can use it to  develop a character or leave it as that

##### Potions an alchemist could create in your world
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Potion of Alert : +5 bonus to passive perception for an hour
| 2.  | Potion of Enhanced Strength +1d6, +4, or +5 (your choice) for strength checks and saves, but not for attacks, for up to an hour.
| 3.  | Alchemist's Fire (from my homebrew) : A deep orange potion that constantly bubbles. Can be used in a Splash Vial to deals an initial 1d6 Fire damage, and sets targets [Ablaze]. Splash radius is 4 meters, and all targets on the edge of the radius must attempt a DC16 Dexterity Saving Throw to successfully move out of range and avoid being set ablaze, although they will still take the initial damage. Targets in the center of the radius must attempt a DC20 Dexterity Saving Throw to successfully move out of range and avoid being set ablaze, although they will still take the initial damage.
| 4. | Ichor of Intensity : The user's body heat increases tenfold and the user becomes resistant to fire damage (if already reistant becomes immune ). The user's body for the duration of the effect(1 minute ) releases dense steam making the area 10 feet around him heavily obscured and every creature entering the area for the first time or finishing their turn in the area take 3d6 fire damage(user is unaffected by these effects ). After the effect of the potion is over the user gains a level of exhaustion
| 5.  | Unstable Potion : Upon consumption, roll on the Wild Magic table to see what happens
| 6.  | Potion of Borrowed Luck : Using a 4 leaf clover and a bit of your user's hair, the user gains one luck point to roll an additional D20 on a roll. However - this extra bit of luck is borrowed from the user itself - allowing the DM to use the roll you neglected later on.
| 7.  | Time shift Potion : Target is sent d4 rounds forward in time. To everyone else it looks like the target simply disappeared.
| 8.  | Potion of Reverse potential : Your actual age and the age you would die of natural cause (calaculated at the current time) are swapped and you start aging backwards Effects canot be reversed by non magical means
| 9.  | Unstable Potion of Invisibility: Gain invisibility for 1d20 minutes (Player is unaware of length of time)
| 10. | Draught of Vigor: For 3d10 minutes, the next time you would receive healing, you also gain temporary hit points equal to half the amount of the hit points restored by the healing.

##### Minor mutations (likely temporary) gained from a strange potion
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | blackmarket "potion of strength" grants you an extra arm for 1d4 hours. the arm is most of the time not one of a mature adult. Roll a d20 to work out what age it would fit with. eg roll a 5 you have a 5 year olds arm.

##### Festivals for your party to blunder into. Specify the name of the holiday, what it is celebrating, and give it a twist
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Bloodmoon festival. Celebrated by drow once a year on the winter solstice to celebrate lolth. Human sacrifices are made to the spider pit and watched by all nobility.
| 2.  | Loki Moon Festival. The Moon Turns a Purple Hue with a Green Sliver down the middle making it look like a serpents eye. This happens once every decade on a random night. This gives reign to all to kill one man/woman from each tribe and gain all that they own with no repercussions.  This is how the Red dragon took control of the Island my players now live on. On that fateful night he went to each Jarl of the 13 tribes and killed them that night. Within the rights of the Night he gained control and became king of the North.
| 3.  | Saint Rich festival. A once per year festival all about the man that saved the village 20 years ago from an army of skeletons. In reality a Lich came by to test his army raising abilities and covered it up by saying his name was Rich and that he came to save the village.
| 4.  | Soulbinding festival. In small communities of Elves, when a child is born it is a big occasion. Elves do not celebrate birthdays or many other holidays but the religious festival of planting a sapling and through ritual binding the newborn's life with the tree. When Elves eventually do celebrate an event, there is lots of drinking afterwards of which could rival the Dwarves.
| 5.  | Festival of Silence : A community descends upon a monastary/temple to share in their vow of silence for 24 hours. In a test of dedication to the gods, anyone who makes the slightest noise is struck once by everyone who heard it.
| 6.  | Rauck-Chauv : It's like a holiday! Only it isn’t on the calendars, and instead of dancing you knock people flat, and instead of giving gifts you break stuff.
| 7.  | White : A new festival dedicated to Rao, the god of peace and reason. The color symbolizing a clean slate, for the day you give up all conflict and release all grudges you may have against a particular person or group of people. If they are nearby it is recommended to confront them and settle it as soon as possible in peaceful agreement. Should you still hold resentment you will be cursed with eternal conflict until penance or death.
| 8.  | Yorti : A halfling celebration at first, this festival has gained a lot of traction in recent years, humanoids from all races flock halfling villages to join this once in a year event. The festival main theme is dancing, it's participants begin dancing traditional dances without stop throughout the night (and sometimes throughout the day ) and the last person dancing is considered the king or queen of the festival. He or she gets to ask one thing from the other participants as a prize (in the past it has been usually used to ask someones hand in marriage, gain a gold piece from each participant or gain a more favourable position in halfling society ). Surprisingly Orcs love this festival and have been witnessed trying to adapt it to their own culture and attending in mass the original one.
| 9.  |  Preparation Day AKA Day of the Grave Robbers : The day before the first funeral of the year, townsfolk are encouraged to dig up graves in the crowded local cemetery, to "accept gifts" from the dead and to make room for the newly deceased (all dug-up bodies are burned afterwards). This day is viewed by the locals as a communion with the dead and as comfort to grieving families to let them know that their loved ones will have a place in the afterlife, though some suspect it was started long ago by a necromancer. Plus, you noticed last year that your old neighbor Ruth was buried with a VERY nice necklace and you can't just let that go.
| 10. | The Festival of Flowers : A three day celebration at the end of summer to the turning of fall. The Festival of Flowers derives its name from the flowers associated with each day of the festival and what they represent. The Festival represent life in all its facets, celebrating the three most important things to life. Death, Love, and the Future. On the first day there are no celebrations, instead it is a very solemn day, as this is the day of remembrance. Tradition is to visit the graves of lost family or loved ones and decorate them with flowers, or just putting a single flower or bouquet on the grave. Toward the evening some select communities may break the solemn tone and actually celebrate by putting on masks or paint their faces to look like skulls. (Think Day of the Dead in mexico) On the second day the celebrations turn a bit more lively. The second day is the day of love. It is the day for couples to spend time with one another, putting everything aside and focusing solely on their partner. However, it is not only the day for couples. Throughout the day, many singles go around, putting on a brave face, and ask out whoever they're interested in. Many new couples are formed on the second day of flowers, just a season before the cold winter. Traditionally, one would present a red flower of any sort to your partner or whom you're asking out. The third day of the festival of flowers celebrates the future of life and what is to come. Families spend the day together, focusing on the children. There tend to be many activities set up in most towns, like town-wide games of hide and seek, flowercrown braiding all of them customarily including a white flower to represent the pureness of youth, or several teams are set up for Spudball (Spudball: imagine baseball with magic) Of course, this being the day of the future of life... What may the couples, both the ones that were together before the festival and the new ones from day before, spend the day doing? Well. If you are born at just the cusp of summer, you may find that you'll be referred to as a Flower Child. As it was exceptionally likely that you were conceived during the Festival of Flowers. This is a festival that is currently happening in one of the campaigns I'm in, and it has been a blast roleplaying the solemn sorrow for lost friends and family, listening to the awkward flirting between player, as well as players and DM when a player character wished to confess their feelings for one of the NPCs, as well as seeing the children on the third day lively up the town. It has all been very cute and flavourful.

##### 10 minor magical items/tools found in an ancient elvish/dwarvish ruin
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | A small, intricately-carved bronze hammer with dwarvish writing etched into the handle. When lightly tapped on a stone wall less than one foot thick, a 1x1 foot section of the wall crumbles into dust. Not large enough for most people to crawl through, unfortunately. Each time it is used, the effect gets 1 inch smaller in each direction
| 2.  | A bronze wrench that will always fit the knut it's meant to fit up to 2 ft diameter. 1/10 chance of tightening the knut so hard it will never be loosened by mortal means.
| 3.  | An ornate longbow wrapped in a long strip of paper with a traditional poem in elvish scribed on it.
| 4.  | A carved wooden flute shaped like a feather that, when blown, makes no sound that humanoids can perceive, but after a few minutes summons a flock of 1d4×10 birds.
| 5.  | A crude stone dwarven chisel, this chisel can carve one small object once per day once directed what to carve. Complexity differs from how detailed you know/recall the object.
| 6.  | A small puzzle box - made of 5-6 pieces, with dwarven runes inscribed on the outside. Requires increasingly difficult intelligence checks to solve the puzzle box to reach the center for a prize. Failing results in a small effect such as an electric shock, Hair changes pink, etc. Can only attempt to solve part of the box once per day.
| 7.  | An enchanted Elven ear thimble (ear cover?).

| 2.  | In a black box in the back of the shop, layered with enough chains to stop a Tarrasque in its tracks, lies a single sweet. This sweet is so potent, so sweet, that a single lick causes the taster to go absolutely mad for sugar, to replicate that high. They seek out all the sugar they can, no matter where or who it is in. Worse, even the after taste lingering in the tasters mouth can inspire other to the same depths of addiction, spreading the madness further and further and further. Chocolatiers everywhere whisper in fear...of the Achocalypse.
| 3.  | A mixing bowl that licks itself clean.
| 4.  | The fondue fountain of ever flowing chocolate. No matter how much it is used, the chocolate never needs replenishing and never spoils.

| 6.  | Prophetic Profiterole - These chocolate dipped puffs are rumored to possess fortune telling properties. Before taking a bite the owner may ask a question. If the filling is sweet it is a good omen, if tart the petitioner should be cautious.
| 7.  | A ladle and pot that perfectly adjusts any food food placed within to a perfect serving temperature. Chocolates melt, soup steams, milk cools, etc. There are rumors of a lost lid for the pot, but not even the chocolatier knows what will happen if it is united with the other two relics.
| 8.  | A tin of cookies (you know the tin) that tastes exactly like your grandmother used to make. Gives a bonus to recalling memories about your childhood. The cookies can be replenished by any skilled baker. Holds 12.
| 9.  | Cocoa Tree - Nestled in the corner of his shop, the Chocolatiers prized plant is so nondescript one wouldn't notice it without it being pointed out to them. Funny thing is this plant's cocoa pods produce gold.
| 10. | Tri Temperature treat: This magical sweet has 3 distinct layers to it, each of a different texture and temperature. The first layer is a hard cool coating of smooth milk chocolate, with excellent taste but nothing distinctly abnormal. The second layer is hot and fluid, a mixture of hot cocoa and melted chocolate, at the perfect temperature to warm up with. The third innermost layer is soft and cold, reminiscent of ice cream or pudding. Each layer can be enjoyed separately over time, or one can bite into it to get the whole menagerie into your mouth and onto your tastebuds at once.

##### Uncommon magical herbs and fungi and their (usually mild) effects
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Magyk Moss - Restores a single 1st level spell-slot when brewed into a tea and consumed over a short rest.
| 2.  | Boiling root - when put in water, it heats it up to boiling temperature (thus replacing the fire for making a stew)
| 3.  | Sneezmenot Grass - Coated with a mild pollen that when inhaled causes one to exhibit the sensation of an oncomming sneeze but they are unable to finish it.
| 4.  | Silvereye Whisps - A silver grainlike plant with thin bulbous membrane at the end, resembling a large eye. When boiled into a tea, causes temporary short-sightedness, but increased awareness of the supernatural, preventing being such as ghosts to hide from you.
| 5.  | Deathwort Mushroom - A Black Mushroom with Two white dots, resembling a skull. When combined with spices and the magical energy of a 1st level spell slot over a short rest, the mushroom can be boiled and eaten to produce the effects of the "Feign Death" spell, except the Duration is until the target drinks the water that the Mushroom was Boiled in.
| 6.  | Cat's Tongue- A pale leaf growing from a bud that just peeks above the ground. When consumed it relaxs inhibitions relating to speaking, causing the patient to not shut up.
| 7.  | Landlubbers love- a seaweed that when chewed resets the inner ear thereby allowing the patient to no longer feel sea sickness. However they now suffer from landsickness and need another dose once on steady ground or will have their equilibrium thrown off until they do.
| 8.  | Caver's Boon- a deep purple, faintly luminescent lichen that when ground up and mixed with water turns into a thin slime. Smearing this slime into the eyes of a creature improves the ability of the creature to see in the dark for the next several hours, but at the cost of being sensitive to light. Prolonged use can lead to the whites of the eyes staining a pale purple.
| 9.  | Aasimar Fluff - a white, cloudlike flower that grows around berry bushes as a weed. The fluff is sticky and full of seeds. When birds and other animals go to retrieve the berries of other plants, they often brush against the plant and get some of the fluff stuck to them, coating their feathers and skin with the white, seed-coated fluff. The white fluff looses its stickiness within half a day or so, by which point the animal has moved far enough to disperse its seeds.
| 10. | Goodie Grass - a tan-beige colored tall grass that grows at the edges of Drow society. Concentrated, it can make a concoction that causes disguise self on a wearer to appear as a high elf.

None of his many, many offspring stick around.

| 1.  | Jack Gentlefoot, Goliath Renegade Fighter who owns the Roaring Hearth. An inn he founded after serving 25 years on the frontlines against ther northern hordes.
| 2.  | Joe mamma, a very nice half ogre and retired adventure. When he told the rouge about his plans to retire and open an inn the halfling glibly suggested he call it 'jo Mamma's house. It took joe 5 years to get the joke, but he still thinks it's hilarious, and took on the surname 'Mamma' so no one could claim it isn't his bar.
| 3.  | Frank deBeans -  A perpetually sweaty barkeep that will always provide okay food but surprisingly good advice.  Can't be bothered to run a clean establishment, but won't tolerate bad customers
| 4.  | Davvy Denito. Owns Pubby’s Pad. He and “the regulars” get up to the occasional hijink that an adventure party may help with.
| 5.  | Amy Kegmapper. Works at a tavern called "The Frothy Mug." More than happy to leave an open tab, so long as the party keeps talking of their adventures.
| 6.  | Baal, a blue tiefling that owns the Blue Balor. He is secretly a demonic Balor that settled for a simple life running a tavern. A no-nonsense type of guy, if anyone tries to murderhobo or scam the bartender, he shapeshifts back into his true form and... handles the situation...
| 7.  | Erekday Arnellday, a halfling who made a deal with a hag for one of her famous drinks, but in exchange can only speak and be spoken about in pig latin

##### Useless or Very Frustrating magical weapons
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Scabbard of Peace: you can't draw a sword from it with the intent of hurting someone
| 2.  | Hammer of Wood Slaying: Attempts to use it as a regular hammer fail miserably, as it always misses the metal nail. Functions as a plus 1 weapon to hit wooden constructs.
| 3.  | Ghost Blade: goes right through creatures unless they're incorporeal...or you are
| 4.  | Jacket of Visibility: Speak the command word and for the next hour this normally mundane looking jacket will undulate with neon stripes and flashing lights. When not worn, the jacket is nearly impossible to find, as it blends in with the rest of your belongings.
| 5.  | Stone of Slope Detection. This nearly perfectly round pebble will begin rolling towards the lower level of any slope it is placed on.
| 6.  | Bustlefiller's Ever-Filling Flask: Provides an endless supply of a refreshing beverage with mild healing properties. However, the enchantment slightly overestimated the volume of the flask, so the flask leaks. The beverage has a scent that attracts both vermin and bears, goes rancid quickly outside the flask, and when enough beverage leaks out it becomes an ooze that might attack you.
| 7.  | Sword of Ice: a powerful sword that is imbued with all sorts of durability, dragon-slaying, giant-slaying, and light-emitting enchantments, but that was inexplicably not given a ward against melting. Currently stored in a jar as a sloshy fluid that glows. Best of luck getting the sword back to its original condition.
| 8.  | Sword of 1 thousand strikes: Makes 1 thousand strikes in one round of combat, requires 1 thousand people to wield.
| 9.  | Spear of Divine Might: Once per day, when you strike a creature, roll a percentile die (d100). if you roll your level or lower, the spear deals 7 times it's normal damage. Once this property has been triggered it cannot be triggered again for seven days.
| 10. | Counterfeit Coin: magically turns currency around it into altered versions of the former print, making it appear fake. indistinguishable from non-magic gold pieces

##### Mysterious Islands and a matching plot-hook.
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | The Frostgate. An island far to the north, rocky and with little greenery. It's most interesting site is a huge stone arch at it's northernmost point, carved over with symbols and laced with ancient magic. Some say that if you step through from the Material Plane at the height of winter solstice, you'll arrive in the Frostfell. But no one ever said anything about what might come through in the opposite direction.
| 2.  | Message in a Bottle. An uncharted island appears to have attracted to it every message in a bottle ever thrown into the ocean. One cannot even walk its beaches without stumbling over glass, smoothed by the sea. But what do the messages say? And why have they all landed here?
| 3.  | The Lost City of Ys. Not far from the coastline cliffs, an island has risen from the waves. The seaweed that coat it are so huge that they stand as tall as trees, stems stiff as tree-trunks, and the structures there, though odd in formation and not well suited to walking through, are well suited to flight - and are shockingly well-maintained. You've been assigned to help the assigned archaeological team investigate, in case any of the plants or few creatures that surfaced with the island decide to attack. But no one is prepared for the aquatic tribe that attacks in the dead of night, reclaiming their risen homeland.
| 4.  | The rich city of Khull. A Tabaxi tribe arrived on a wild island dozens of years ago. What we know about it now ? It's one of the richiest cities in all Faerun. They celebrate each month a weird festival during which they dance around the statue of a gigantic eye and lay offerings all around it. They also paint the statue that remain so decorated until the next month. The leader of the Tabaxi tribe is actually a powerful mage who stole a legendary beholder's eye and is using it's dreamy creative magic to produce ressources of all sort, and trade with coastal cities.
| 5.  | The Ashen Isle of the Ozia. The regular and powerful eruptions of this volcano scar the nearby shores with vast sheets of glass. Nearby towns are constantly dealing with the influx of ash falling over their houses and rumors abound of figures seen within the glowing stone and grey clouds. These aren't natural disasters. A group of adventurers has been sent in to stop the constant eruptions. They weren't prepared for the thousands of warrior souls bound and crusading for the Molten king.
| 6.  | Kamē an island inhabited by a peace loving farmers and fishermen that was discovered just a short sail off the coast some 20 years back. The farmers sell small quantities of an oil prized for producing life extending elixers, but only sell a tiny ammount each year. The King has declared his intent to annex the island and seize the source of the prized oil, "for the goog of the people" of course. The warfleet could not find the island somehow. Can the party discover the islands secret? (Hint in the name)  If they do will they claim the reward, or....
| 7.  | First it was a rock. Then it was a mountain. Then it was an island. The stone growth exploded in size out off the coast of Telemere, nearly quadrupling in size each day. And it doesn't  seem to be showing any sign of stopping. The monarch of Telemere has ordered us to find out what this island is, what's causing it to grow, and how to stop it before it entombs the entire nation beneath its mass. Little did we know, the monarch was asking the wrong questions. It wasn't what was making the island grow. It was what was pushing the stone up from below.
| 8.  | Karnassos - Isle of Monsters. Here several rifts in space-time have opened up, causing monsters of sorts to leak into the material plane. The party requires the byproduct of a powerul monster found only on that island and have thus reached out to the Monster Hunters on the island for aid in locating the monster's nest.
| 9.  | The Island Island. In the middle of the island is an island. In the middle of that island is another island. Inside of that island is another island, containing an island within an island. There's more and more islands within them. Where does it end?
| 10. | Sannikov Land. Technically, it doesn't exist. It wasn't there yesterday. It may be there now. Will it be there tomorrow? Who knows. Your job to find out.

##### Unique cars on an extremely magical never ending train. (Ex: miniature circus/zoo of monstrosities)
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Wardback Car. From inside, everything outside seems to be moving the opposite direction.
| 2.  | Memory Lane. The car from each end is lined with mirrors, when passing them shows events from the characters past.

| 4.  | Aquarium Car. This car is underwater and full of tropical fish.
| 5.  | The janitors car. Lines of doors open into dozens of windowless rooms stocked with cleaning supplies. If the party is very clever they may figure out that these rooms are the janitors closets for every station on the rail line. Once inside you just have to open the door the right way to open to the station or the train. This really simplifies the janitors stocking of supplies.

| 7.  | Nightmare Car. In order to optimize the passenger's experience, a mild charm siphons away their anxieties and fears while they use the train. Such negativity is gathered into this car, where it forms a horrifying amalgamation of darkness. (In a comedy game it might be only minor grievances, like the embodiment of a chair being slightly to small, or food being just a little salty, etc)
| 8.  | Reverse car, this car seems to be moving in the opposite direction on the tracks from the rest. This is because time is flowing backwards. Very useful if you missed your stop.

| 8.  | An elephant with very large ears
| 9.  | Cloud Mimics
| 10. |  Penguins. Thought they couldn't fly didn't you?

##### Most distracting side quests
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Larry Needs Paints - Local celebrity, Larry the Nothic, a one-time warlock turned lovable monstrocity who paints the wall of the village with graffti that wards away larger animals has run out of paints! However the only type of paint that works is made from a town on the other side of the province!
| 2.  | Little Tammy (name can be changed). A little girl in the party's home base town wants to be an adventurer too! She's even got a magic [X] that she'll give the party if she can come with them on a quest! She cries and turns petulant if she's refused! The town dotes on her! Can't you just make a little girl happy for a few minutes, you freakin' monsters?! I thought you were heroes!
| 3.  | Distraction Artifact - The party receives a quest to deliver a volatile magic item that creates distractions around it in a 120 foot radius. Little did the party know that the special container containing the effect has been breached and are unable to deliver the artifact since they keep getting side quests... Skyrim Syndrome.
| 4.  | It’s your mother. She tracked down your adventuring party because she needs you to pick up eggs on your way home.
| 5.  | Abberant Tree Cats. Adorable kitties keep appearing in the town trees. Every time you take one down, a new one comes up
| 6.  | Ghosts who only the party can see but only have like vaguely mundane bullshit they need your help with so they can move on.
| 7.  | Local bard wont leave your party alone until you give him a story. He makes you pay off all the debts he's owed in the city until you tell him a good enough story.
| 8.  | Two NPCs (possibly low tier villains) are engaged, but can't marry because of family drama. The party must either settle things with their families, or convince the couple to forsake their inheritance. (Actual distracting quest that served as the primary motivator for half my party to do the real main quest. My players just could not see that ship abandoned)
| 9.  | An NPC is building a grandfather clock for his girlfriend, but he needs a suitable minute hand. Another NPC two towns over has a minute hand, but he'll only trade it for a fruit that's out of season. A botanist across the lake figured out a way to grow that fruit, but she needs the right type of compost. A farmer three days' walk down can give you the compost for free, provided that you figure out how to keep the foxes out of his chicken coop. A shophand in the first NPC's town sells fox repellent, but the recipe is a family secret, so she'd like another secret in exchange. The king has a secret he's dying to tell, but he doesn't want to leave his room until his broken necklace is fixed. There's a jeweler in the royal district, but she'll always be asleep at her stall until you get her a proper timekeeping device, like a grandfather clock.
| 10. | Lost Child. You find a kid wandering the streets, homeless, who kinda looks like one of your party's members...

##### All-powerful wizards who specialized in something super weird
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Red Butterfly, grand arcanist in the art of Feng Shui. Her spells are said to shift the flow of magic in the land itself.
| 2.  | "The Radiant Sound", a master illusionist who spends their time creating grand shows of synesthesia, rather than performing world-saving magicks.
| 3.  | The greatest master of Resurrection spells whoever lived but is currently focused on resurrecting only bugs for some reason he can only explain in insect noises.
| 4.  | The archmage who focused so innately on dream magic that they've been asleep for the last 20 years.
| 5.  | Percival the Perfectionist. Specializes in exact and gentle magics for delicate operations, mostly involving the folding of paper. Most well known spells include "Percival's Paper Partridge" and "Percivals Perfectly Prepared Parcel"
| 6.  | The great wizard who's only spell is making you believe he is a great wizard. Dc 35 wisdom save. Its even worked on dragons and liches!
| 7.  | Super sleazy tiefling enchantment wizard, clad in a tasteful neutral blue suit. Can perfectly cast any enchantment spell, given that its target has some association with warm colors like rust-red, bronze-orange, or gold-yellow.
| 8.  | The Somnolent. Perfected the spell of eternal slumber and sleeps in perfect peace, very active in his, and many others dreams though.
| 9.  | Curse of Sentience.  A floating Bagel has been following you around and complaining every time you eat bread.  This has become a problem.  He flies away whenever you try to eat him and screeches that he's under attack, which summons the guards.
| 10. | Microscopi the minificent: master of the smallest subtlest and most insignificant seeming magics. In truth he casts so precisely that he knows the exact scope of the damage the hurrican he causes by casting a tiny illision of a preadotor causing a slight flick of the wings of a buterfly in the mountains 1000miles away.

##### Most intriguing 'were' creatures
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | The weretardigrade. Basically immortal. Can live in space
| 2.  | the Were-hydra, problem is each new head has a new personality, so when you go back to humanoid form it's a mess :grimacing:
| 3.  | Werehuman. Every full moon, it transforms into a different human, with a different life and personality from the original. Once the moon is no longer full, it reverts to its original self.
| 4.  | Werefish. No wonder old man Brooks lives by the sea
| 5.  | Werewolves. One man who turns into two wolves. One is his upper half, the other his lower half. If they're not physically touching at the end of the full moon, the man dies from blood loss as his two halves are separated.
| 6.  | Werechair. Watch out for splinters
| 7.  | Weresomething? We know he transforms into something, but it's something so small and insignificant that you don't notice and he always gets left off lists.
| 8.  | Weredragon.  Exactly as it sounds. A wolf that turns into a dragon every harvest moon.  Wait thats what you thought too right? What? A human that turns into a dragon? Preposterous.
| 9.  | Wearwolf. Turns into a fashion focused wolf on nights of the full moon, they wake up the following day looking fabulous without any memory of buying/making all these outfits and accessories. Allergic to "Off-brand" silver (such a stainless steel)
| 10. | Werebaby. If you’re already sick of cleaning up after your significant other, now you get to do it more!

##### Recipes that didn’t make it into the Heroes’ Feast cookbook
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Roasted Barbarian. (Olgor the ogre is not sure why they wouldn't accept his family's recipe for feasting on heroes) Take one barbarian, and preheat the oven to fireball.
| 2.  | Tarrasque Tonsils Tempura: This dish looks fine, and the chef was sure it would be a hit, but it turns out it gives you a dinosaur sized urge to regurgitate. Fun gift for your enemies.
| 3.  | Hobbit Appetizer. One Heroes' Feast is good for 12 creatures... unless two of them are hobbits in which case they eat eight of the twelve servings. The Hobbit Appetizer spell was a 7th level spell to allow for this.
| 4.  | Fey seasonings. No, you cant have the chicken legs turn you all into dinosaurs. Stop asking.
| 5.  | Dragon pie, it builds a powerful fire in your belly, which is a bit of a problem if you don't breath fire.
| 6.  | That goddamn sentient bagel is back. How did he get put in the spell?!
| 7.  | Kraken, crawfish style. Look I don't know how we're gonna fit them in the pot but it's not going to waste.
| 8.  | Cutlery. All this food shows up but no one ever thought to include knives and forks.  The savages.
| 9.  | Roasted Praying Mantis Teriyaki-Style. Not all Lizardfolk enjoy the taste of human cuisine, after all
| 10. | Soups. We wanted to put em in there, but we just couldn't figure out how to get them to appear in the bowls. It was unsanitary.

##### Roadside conveniences
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | A restroom. It's nice to have a break from going in the woods along the trip.
| 2.  | A guarded camping ground. It's nice to have a break from sleeping in the woods along the trip.
| 3.  | A changing room. It’s nice to have a break from changing your clothes in the woods along the trip.
| 4.  | A small wilderness mail exchange, with a letter for one of the party in there. Or they can commit crime and steal everyone's personal correspondance.
| 5.  | Encounter Review Board. Travelers can post their reviews of local encounters (bandits, beasts, the living dead, etc) with notes for both future travelers and the encounters themselves for ways to improve.
| 6.  | Whack a goblin game: for when you need to kill just a couple more critters to level before you get to the real encounter.
| 7.  | A cask.  Once tapped, it dispenses endless garlic mashed potatoes. No you cant take it with you.
| 8.  | A cairn. Its nice to have a break from burying your dead friends in the woods along the trip.
| 9.  | A wishing well. You're not sure if it will work however, but does it really matters ?
| 10. | A camp ground with an animated shrub who gives directions.

##### Rakshasa pet projects
| 1D10 | Result |
|:---:|:-------------|
| 1.  | Unleashing their overlord master from their crystal prison hidden away in the depths of the world. And really bonding with all the minions they recruit along the way.
| 2.  | Severing the hands of their acolytes and sewing them on backwards
| 3.  | Ordering their minions to construct a giant underground maze for all the kidnapped orphans.
| 4.  | Bonsai, soo relaxing and meditative
| 5.  | Slowly peeling the entire epidermis in one piece off of prisoners kept alive through magic, so relaxing and meditative
| 6.  | Casting various awakening spells on tigers to see if they can get one to become sentient.
| 7.  | Spending centuries breeding the "perfect" minions from humanoid stock, much like Victorian dog breeding. Humans with extra long limbs and a nervous tick. Halflings half their normal size who shake when excited and have poor bladder control. Dwarves who are covered head to toe in shaggy hair and require daily bathes and trimming to keep in check.
| 8.  | Yes I spent my free time waiting for you adventurers by taking up knitting. I hope you like looting nothing but lace doilies.  Idiots.
| 9.  | Coming up with the perfect joke so all the enemies would simply laugh to death. Whoever doesnt laugh at the jokes also gets murdered so its a win win either way.
| 10. | Interior decorating. Donnot bleed on the carpets.
